    :synopsis: Contract life cycle test package
    
The contract.core.test package provides a suite of unit tests
exploring aspects of contract life cycle requirements.

In order to run any of the tests, the 'APP_ROOT' environment variable has
to be set to point to the folder containing the schema files (i.e. `'/root/projects/ondalear/src'`).
